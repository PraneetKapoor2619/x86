# Course: Microprocessors and Microcontrollers  
  
The codes presented here were written and ran as part of lab work of a course on Microprocessors and Microcontrollers I took in the 6th semester of my bachelors in EEE (2021). Except for add.asm, all codes were ran on emu8086.  
The code l6sqrwave.asm doesn't work as expected: it was written to interface with a virtual 8254 IC. I followed the instructions given by the developer of emu8086 on how to create and run a virtual device, however, the most-sought-after file, emu8086.io, was not created when running emu8086 on Windows 10. When ran on Linux Mint 20.1 Ulyssa using wine, it was created, but still unaccessible by my code.   Probably some day I will make my own 8086 emulator.
